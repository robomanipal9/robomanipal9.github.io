            <p class="text-center"><strong>Electromyography:</strong> One of our members, Sidhartha Dey, recently completed a project on the concept of Electromyography(EMG) i.e. measurement of myoelectric signals involved in muscle activation and contraction. With this, one
              can measure the response of a muscle, say, for example, the biceps muscle, to a specific stimulus or an action, such as picking up a book. The basis behind EMG lies in the fact that the electrical signals sent to the muscle can be picked
              up on the surface of the skin, using electrodes, at the desired muscle location. This allows one to compare the electrical signals being sent to the muscle with the physical response of the muscle itself. </p>

The aim of this project is to analyse and develop an algorithm for walking for a 2-legged robot. The first version of the robot will be designed using smart servos. The walking algorithm will be developed using reinforcement learning, and tested using open-source V-REP and ROS environments. In this project, gait analysis will also be done to develop an optimum gait for the design. Bipedal walking has a large number of applications due to its flexibility and ability to traverse uneven terrain. This walking algorithm can be further developed in applications for humanoid robots. </p>

              mechanism, with this kind of actuator, one can easily attain joint motion as shown in the first diagram. If used with proper control theories, then it’ll make a very stable base for motion. Software VReP will be used for simulation and inverse
              kinematics. A genetic algorithm will be trained to attain walking motion.

              one the featured event in TechTatva and we have participants from all over the south zone. Members of RoboManipal participate in different events during our techfest too. Robotrek is one such event, which includes events like "mesh", "vertigo"

            <p><strong>ABU ROBOCON :</strong> The annual international Robotics competition organised by Asia - Pacific Broadcasting Union, ABU ROBOCON calls for multiple robots to work in synchrony in a given arena to finish a predefined task in a stipulated
              period of time. Founded in 2002 the competition has become among the largest, most competitive and reputed robotics competitions in the world. Each year Robocon releases a problem statement that forces the teams to think laterally and come
              up with innovative and efficient solutions. However recent years have seen a considerable shift in its format, which now focuses more on innovation and application of complex ideas rather than just the end goal of winning. Each participating
              country organizes an annual national level competition where all eligible colleges compete. The winning college gets to represent their nation at the international level Robocon, hosted by a different nation each year. India hosts the annual
              national level Robocon at Pune. Last year's theme was NÉM CÒN : The Festival Wishing Happiness and Prosperity. The concept of the ABU Robocon 2018's Theme & Rules was based on an interesting folk game called “ Shuttlecock Throwing”. The
              heart and soul of this game is the Shuttlecock.
