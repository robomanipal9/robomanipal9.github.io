            <p class="text-center"><strong>Electromyography:</strong> One of our members, Sidhartha Dey, recently completed a project on the concept of Electromyography(EMG) i.e. measurement of myoelectric signals involved in muscle activation and contraction. With this, one can measure the response of a muscle, say, for example, the biceps muscle, to a specific stimulus or an action, such as picking up a book. The basis behind EMG lies in the fact that the electrical signals sent to the muscle can be picked up on the surface of the skin, using electrodes, at the desired muscle location. This allows one to compare the electrical signals being sent to the muscle with the physical response of the muscle itself. </p>

This system allows any person to operate a gurney without any effort or hassles, especially during emergency situations. </p>

A replacement for existing taps having atomizers in parallel and water pressurized by a localized compressor. It gives the same cleaning efficiency of tap water in the same time span and saving about 90% of water while doing so. This not only saves a lot of water, but also saves electricity that was being used to pump the water.. </p>

This includes the quality of surveillance. Humans are not the best in the field
of surveillance, plus it requires too much effort.

it also includes accessibility to remote areas is still a problem

and quick accessibility during a terrorist attack or in a warzone at
important sites

as well as autonomous target selection </p>

circuit failure. For the 2017 season of Robocon, this circuit would be used to measure current

was not used in the final bot. </p>

If used with proper control theories, then itâ€™ll make a very stable base for motion.

            <p>We hold regular workshops of basic robotics to help and teach robotics enthusiasts. We intend to help students who are interested in robotics and related fields but lack the required knowledge to build the robot. Our workshop is open to anybody who needs our assistance and our team members are always willing to help.
Nothing draws a crowd in a technical festival like the sound of metal crashing against metal. "Robowars" is one of the most popular events in TechTatva. Robowars is one the featured event in TechTatva and we have participants from all over the south zone. Members of RoboManipal participate in different events during our techfest too. Robotrek is one such event, which includes events like "mesh", "vertigo" and "Robo-Pacman" in which our team members participated and won cash prizes. </p>
